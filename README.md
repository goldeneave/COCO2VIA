# coco2VIA
the repo attach the code transer coco format to VIA format

Recently I fine tuned the Mask RCNN model, however, I get my dataset into coco format at start. 
When I refer the code in MRCNN official repo, it used the annotation file is generated by VIA, and I do not find any code could transfer coco format into VIA, so I launched this repo and attach related code

## By the way, I make mistake when I named the uploaded file, and I am sure the code is correct, but I am too lazy to modify it, so just use is on your custom dataset
